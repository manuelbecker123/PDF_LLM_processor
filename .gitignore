# Config - if you want to ensure local config isn't committed by accident
# if you provide a config.example.py instead
# config.py

# Output folders (users should manage their own output)
# Consider adding patterns if your output folders in config.py are static,
# e.g., /Extracted_Content/* , /Processed_Output/*
# However, it's often better to let users decide if they want to track their output.
# For now, we'll leave this to the user. If config.py has default paths like
# "/Users/YOUR_USER/...", these won't be matched by simple patterns here anyway.

# API keys and sensitive files if not using environment variables
# (though config.py is designed to be edited by the user)
